# dotfile

## usage
```zsh
stow */
```
basically it means stow all the directory.On the top of that syncing independently is acceptable

## note
1. the default target of stow is the parent directory so make suure the current directory is in the dotfile
2. the home folder contain the file which should be placed in the home directory
